Backscatter SenseTab node
We push the IRE iatrotechnique forward into the non-invasive human natural lumen cancer treatment filed by introducing a battery-free, flexible and computable niche, named SenseTab. This diminutive piezoelectric backscatter device can be wirelessly charged to release IRE pulses and communicated via ultrasonic waves.
